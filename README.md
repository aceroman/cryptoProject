# Secure Password Manager

This is a secure command-line password manager (for now)

## Purpose
I made this project because a lot of family members in my life have always forgtten the passwords to their accounts. Although right now it is a command-line program, there is still development for this program. 

## Features
- Store and retrieved encrypted passwords
- Update and delete stored passwords
- secure encryption (AES-256)
